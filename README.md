### Obscene sudo for OSX (sudo 1.7.10p7)
> *Up-to-date if you're using 10.9 Mavericks or 10.10 Yosemite*

In OSX, ``sudo`` is compiled without insults. That means that even if you *tell* sudo to show them to you, it just won't, because they're not embedded in the executable. 

Therefore, if you'd like to get insulted whenever you mistype your password, you'll have to recompile it... That sucks, ain't it :weary:

Fortunately, I did it for you ! I recompiled sudo **WITH INSULTS** from Apple's official repo. To enable insults, follow this guide : http://www.cnx-software.com/2012/06/05/how-to-let-sudo-insult-you-when-you-type-the-wrong-password/
